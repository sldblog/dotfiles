To install, clone this repository and run `bin/bootstrap`.

## Goals

Provide an environment with minimal setup that runs on

- Arch Linux
- or MacOS

"Minimal" in my case means the following installed with my preferred configuration:

- git with a global gitignore
- oh-my-zsh with my favourite prompt
- vim and Visual Studio Code
- Elixir and Python
- Docker, kubectl
